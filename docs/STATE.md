# STATE

## Current milestone

**Plan complete, awaiting the owner's go.** No code exists yet. Next command after approval:
`/scaffold` (milestone M0 in `docs/PLAN.md`).

## Done

- 2026-11-12 — Product name fixed by the owner: **Boma Bot** (`@boma/*`, `BOMA_*`, `com.boma.app`).
  Rebuild of the target analysed in `../re-workspace`. The analysed tree keeps its own identifiers so
  `file:line` citations stay valid.
- 2026-11-12 — Spec exported from `../re-workspace` with `tools/export-spec.sh`: 48 files, 58
  requirements, 30 API goldens, 7 UI goldens; golden sanity and secret scan clean (0 warnings).
  Manifest in `spec/EXPORT.md`. **CONFIRMED** (command output).
- 2026-11-12 — `/plan` written: `docs/PLAN.md` (scope, stack table, architecture, budgets, M0–M11,
  defect map, test strategy, UI plan) and 19 ADRs in `docs/adr/`. **CONFIRMED** (files exist).

## Next

1. Owner reviews `docs/PLAN.md` §2 (stack table) and vetoes any row.
2. Owner answers the three open GUESS items (DEC-01…DEC-03) if they have runtime knowledge; otherwise
   they are re-verified at implementation time.
3. `/scaffold` → M0: workspace, lints, CI, migrations binary, `/healthz` + `/readyz`, Compose.
4. `/ui-kit` before M1's UI slice (restart opencode afterwards so the BoardUI skill and rules load).

## Decisions needed

From `spec/06-decisions-needed.md`. Each has a recommendation recorded in an ADR; silence means the
recommendation stands.

| Id | Question | Recommendation | ADR |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEC-01 | Does a reconnect replay events from `Last-Event-ID` in the reference? | **GUESS** yes; we implement resume-by-seq regardless | 005 |
| DEC-02 | Stale fence write: ignored or rejected? | **GUESS** ignored, logged at warn | 004 |
| DEC-03 | Is `waiting_takeover` queue-holding? | Code says yes (CONFIRMED in code); intent **GUESS** | 006 |
| DEC-04 | Surface scope for v1 | Web + desktop; mobile deferred | 013 / 016 |
| DEC-05 | Tenancy model | RLS + typed tenant context | 002 |
| DEC-06 | Agent runtime | Native Rust loop | 004 |
| DEC-07 | Realtime transport | SSE + WS for screen | 005 |
| DEC-08 | Computer providers | Docker supervisor + desktop host | 009 |
| DEC-09 | Billing scope | Limits native, provider behind a port | 012 |
| DEC-10 | Secrets encryption | Envelope, rotatable master key | 008 |
| DEC-11 | Locales at v1 | en + fr + he | 014 |
| DEC-12 | Asset reuse | Nothing visual reused | 015 |
| DEC-13 | Keep RPC procedure names | Yes, for the documented ones | 003 |

## Deferred requirements

| REQ | Why | Where recorded |
|---|---|---|
| REQ-049 (voice, COULD) | Not needed for a functional core; interfaces stay additive | PLAN §5 |
| REQ-056 (mobile, SHOULD) | PWA ships in M1; the Expo shell waits until device pairing is exercised | ADR-016, PLAN §5 |

## Proposals outside the spec

None. Anything proposed during the build goes here first, with the REQ it would touch.

## Known GUESS (to confirm)

- No runtime observation of the reference exists (no install, no Docker, no browser in the analysis
  session). Every `spec/` claim is static or documentation-backed; `spec/TRACE.md` marks the two
  doc-only rows.
- BoardUI Pro is not activated on this machine (`license_status`: none). The UI uses free-tier
  components; a Pro template would be an owner decision plus a licence check before any public repo.
- The JSON Schema validation of `opencode.json` never ran in the analysis workspace; the file was
  edited by hand and reviewed, not validated by a tool.

## What was consulted in the original

| Path | Why |
|---|---|
| `../re-workspace/notes/ARCHITECTURE.md` | entry points, flows, trust boundaries |
| `../re-workspace/notes/validation-audit.md` | V-01…V-09 → defects D-01…D-09 |
| `../re-workspace/notes/open-questions.md` | injection findings, rebuild questions |
| `../re-workspace/notes/spec/**` | the contract itself |
| `../re-workspace/target/rakazo` | only through the citations already recorded in the spec; not re-read in this session |
